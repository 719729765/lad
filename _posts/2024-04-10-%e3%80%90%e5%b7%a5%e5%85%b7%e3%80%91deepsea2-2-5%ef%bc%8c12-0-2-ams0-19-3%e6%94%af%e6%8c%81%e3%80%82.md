That&#39;s because 12.0.2 burnt a fuse and brought the total to 15 fuses. If user is still in 12.0.0-12.0.1 you will still need kip1patch=nogc. If updated to 12.0.2, that line can now be removed if wanted. And as always if auto nogc is not wanted, you can disable it in the Options Tab.</li> <li>Fixed Seamless display for L4T Linux/Android. There was an issue where hekate would clear the bootlogo when launching L4T. That is now fixed and the bootlogo will remain until kernel finishes init.</li> <li>Fixed an issue when a kip patch was defined 2 times it would throw an error.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><h4>下载地址(由网友<font color="red">hgxly007</font>发布)：</h4></p>
