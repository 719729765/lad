 <p>https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases</p> <p>　　Supports HOS firmware 12.1.0 and AMS 0.19.5 - R2</p> <p>　　es and fs patches for HOS 12.1.0</p> <p>　　fs patches now include content check patches to allow the system data corruption checks to work and to support XCI dumps converted into header patched NSPs</p> <p>　　includes fusee and hekate loader patches for AMS 0.19.5, the zip has a build hash of &quot;-9df13781c&quot;.</p> <p>　　a new Atmosphere build (silent update) may require new loader patches.</p> <p>　　Now that tinfoil does not block Hekate patches fusee.zip is an exact copy of hekate.zip. This is done to prevent Hekate users from grabbing fusee.zip then bugging support the world over. If you boot with fusee-primary.bin the extra file will not affect you in any way.</p> <p><h4>下载地址(由网友<font color="red">a535334108</font>发布)：</h4></p>
